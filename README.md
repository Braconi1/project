Project Description: Perfumery "Revlon"

Project Overview:
Within the project Perfumery "Revlon," a website has been created with the aim of promoting and selling products of this perfumery company. The technologies used in building the website are HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

HTML was used for the structure of the web page, defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, and forms. CSS was applied for styling the web page, determining colors, fonts, backgrounds, and layout of elements. Bootstrap was used for quick and efficient design of a responsive and attractive user interface, utilizing ready-made components such as navigation menus, cards, forms, and other elements.

This project focuses on providing users with a pleasant and intuitive experience when browsing products, information about the "Revlon" brand, and contacting the company. The combination of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap enabled the creation of an aesthetically appealing and functional website that reflects the professionalism and recognizability of the "Revlon" brand in the world of perfumes and cosmetics.
