Project Description: Perfumery "Revlon"

DeadLine: 31/03/2024

Project Overview:
Within the project Perfumery "Revlon," a website has been created with the aim of promoting and selling products of this perfumery company. The technologies used in building the website are HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

HTML was used for the structure of the web page, defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, and forms. CSS was applied for styling the web page, determining colors, fonts, backgrounds, and layout of elements. Bootstrap was used for quick and efficient design of a responsive and attractive user interface, utilizing ready-made components such as navigation menus, cards, forms, and other elements.

This project focuses on providing users with a pleasant and intuitive experience when browsing products, information about the "Revlon" brand, and contacting the company. The combination of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap enabled the creation of an aesthetically appealing and functional website that reflects the professionalism and recognizability of the "Revlon" brand in the world of perfumes and cosmetics.

All Page description:
-----------------
index.html
-----------------
When entering the page, a welcome page will appear, which is composed of HTML and CSS. The repository of the page was created with the help of a YouTube video. The navigation bar for desktop users will be horizontal at the top where everything is nicely arranged: About page, Discover, Shop, Contact, Home, etc. 

The repository for mobile users is designed so that when they enter the page, a nav-bar or drop-down menu will appear, allowing easy access to the site. I added an Awesome Icons script, which provides icons for the nav-bar drop-down menu. We also have a logo that when users or clients click on it, it takes them to index.html or the home page. 

In the center of the page, there is a shop button that leads directly to shop.html, i.e., to Discover for perfumes. At the bottom, there is the footer of the page, which was created with the help of YouTube and contains social media icons, contact/support, etc.

----------------------------

-----------
reg.html / login.html
-----------
In kodlog.html, we have everything for the user/client to enter their account details. When they do so and press login, they are redirected to the home page. 

The purpose of this page is to make it easier for users to log in, which includes CSS for the input section and a submit button. The submit button is created using: <button onclick="window.location.href='index.html'">Login</button>, which essentially works when the user clicks the button to redirect them to the home page. 

Of course, people who don't have an account can click on 'Create an Account', which will redirect them to a new page where reg.html is located. The HTML is similar to that of log.html, and in CSS, more input columns have been added for address, name, surname, nickname, email, etc.


----------------------------

-----------
shop.html
-----------

In shop.html, as in every page I explained earlier, there are cards present. These cards contain product descriptions and a Buy button that redirects to the buy section.


----------------------------

-----------
about.html
-----------

In about.html, there is a box containing animated text that will fade in within 0.3 seconds in the CSS file, as well as the logo itself.


----------------------------

Help with repository for the pages: ChatGpt, Black Box AI, Instagram Reels.

I also used CSS help from YouTube and Lms Documents.
